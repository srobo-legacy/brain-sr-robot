# SR-Robot

This is the main Python library for interacting with SR's boards.

It is in many ways the equivalent of pyenv from previous generations of kit.
It is, however, rather different as it is installed int he base system.
It can therefore be upgraded via the same mechanism as any other software
on the base system.

## Documentation

The SR kit docs, including those for programming a robot using this sofware
are online at <https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/>.

## Thread Safety

This library is thread safe.
